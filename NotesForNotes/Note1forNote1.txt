When you name your properties, data and classes 
make sure the first letter is lower case and the rest or the words needs
letters starts capitalized  ie: nameVariable

Also the application is read from top to buttom
So make you your codes are running in a way that 
they can be executed from top to buttom.

When you want to make an object/function
You need to creat a new class and execute
your statements, then call it finally in 
the main class.



string name = Console.ReadLine();
//The statement above takes in a value


if statements are decision statements
if you have only one line of code under an if statement you can ignore the brakets

for Console.read line
If you are using a string in multiple statements,
you can declear the string value as empty, before assigning a value that could be read

string rReader ="";

int i == 2;
if(i == 2)
   Console.Write("Nice Job");

else if(i != 2)
{
Console.Write("what are you doing?");
}
else
{
Consol.Write("Can't get you!");
}

Console.ReadLine();
