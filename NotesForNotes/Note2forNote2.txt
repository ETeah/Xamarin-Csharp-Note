Iteration Statement are use to search for specific value 
in a method to then perform a task. It loops through, to find when 
your code should be run.

for statement is an iteration statement

for(int i = 0; i < 5; i ++)
{
   //the for statement takes an int input
   //this is done by initiating int giving it a name ie: "i"
   //then setting it's limit, and finally incrementing or decrementing it's value

  Console.WriteLine(i);

 //break; is used to exit the for iteration/searching process
 //f9 for vstuido also toggle break point
//can click of the left most - gray part of the interface -red dot appears

    if(f == 4)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("You have {0}", f);
                       break;
                }

}



vs debugging tool
-can step trough the search process in (for) iteration
-first in the normal windows with nothing extra open
-click f10
and you will see a blue circular arrow button
you will also see a continue button
-you can click those to do the search through

--Double tap TAB for a code synapit/complete structure example of a 
function
 type for (double tap tab)
